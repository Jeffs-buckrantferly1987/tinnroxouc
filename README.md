Wow. Just walked out of the theater after seeing Uppercut, and my head is spinning. Kind of like that time I tried to ride a unicycle after one too many beers. Seriously, what even was that? It’s like this 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 tried to throw everything at you but forgot to give you a heads up. I'm talking sweat, blood, and punches, all rolled up in some chaotic masterpiece — if that’s even possible. 

So, here I am, half running on popcorn and overpriced soda, trying to wrap my head around that whirlwind. I mean, one minute you're biting your nails in suspense and the next, there’s this absolutely random shot of a chicken crossing a road. Like what? Is it a metaphor? Or just some director's inside joke? I can't tell at this point.

>The storyline was something else. It was like being thrown into a blender with plot twists coming faster than my aunt’s conspiracy theories about Wi-Fi and bad dreams. And then the characters. Don't even get me started on them. They felt like they crawled straight out of your weird cousin's mind — jagged, raw, and maybe just a little unpredictable. 

There’s this one scene — no spoilers, promise — where the lead does his brooding, existential stare, but I swear, the camera angle made him look like a moody potato. Could barely hold back a giggle. Yet somehow, amidst the chaos and all the potato-esque shots, there’s a weird sense of authenticity. Like an unpolished pebble you find tucked away in your sneaker after a long hike.

Might have to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   just to catch any snippets I missed amidst the bedlam. Either that or enjoy the ride all over again for a second round of “did that really just happen?”

const uppercut = (punch) => {
  return punch === “hard” ? “ouch” : “not again please”;
};

Shoutout to the sound design too, I suppose. It’s like they collaborated with a rock band and a cat having a meltdown. An odd symphony that seemed to fit just right. I can't decide if I want to drown my ears in silence or immediately go 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again just to relive the glorious chaos. Time for a breather first, or maybe a cup of chamomile tea. Or ten.
